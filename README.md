# Network Architecture Search 

## Introductory tutorial
* Machine Learnig  
* Evolution Algorithm
    - [莫烦Python 进化算法 简介](https://morvanzhou.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning/evolutionary-algorithm/1-01-intro/) 
    - [A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017)  
    NSGAII is the most popular Evolution algorithm. And it's also the best EA paper for newcomer.(Because I did this LOL.)  
    And you can find NAGAII and Other EA's code [HERE](./Code/).
* Reinforcement Learning
* AutoML

## 1.Introduction 
NAS can be seen as subfield of [AutoML](https://www.ml4aad.org/automl/) and has signicant overlap with hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning.
In NAS, We can divide it into EA(GA) + NAS, RL + NAS(and so on...I am going to summarize them).

## 2.Reviews
* 09.08, 2018 [Neural Architecture Search: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377)  
This is the latest review of NAS.

## 3.Papers
1. EA(GA) + NAS
1. RL + NAS
