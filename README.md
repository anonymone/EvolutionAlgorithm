# Evolution Algorithm rope  
This repo includes some classical evolution algorithms and testing problems. And it is devoloping in process.

# How to use it(Developing)  
Up to now, I have no clear idea of how to devolop this platform. But it's in plan. I have proposed a instant way to use it. 
Type this command in root.  
```python run.py```
